Taxi Driver is a movie directed by cinema legend Martin Scorsese, it tells the story of a mentally troubled Vietnam War veteran 
turned taxi driver, Travis Bickle, and how the unhealthy state of his mind affects his actions and reasoning. The movie is very 
much ahead of it's time and the themes it tackles are still relevant to this day despite being made in the 70s. The loneliness I felt 
while watching the movie is an uncanny experience, since I didn't expect I will ever relate to a lonely taxi driver with mental health 
issues. The shots of the movie are filmed in an unconventional way, a decision made by the director to disrupt the viewers 
and make them feel that something is wrong. It starts off slow but it all comes crashing down to a brutal climax, the movie was considered 
very violent at the time and the crew had to work around being censored. Taxi Driver is a movie experience that will forever stay with me,
it is an amazing film and probably one of the best ones ever made, but it is not for those who are looking for a casual movie experience.
<br>
<br><br>
I give this movie a rating of <b>9/10</b>, many people claim that this is Scorsese's best work and I definitely understand why they would say
that. Despite being considered an arthouse film it was a box office success, primarily because a lot of those who watched the film at the time,
related to the loneliness of Travis and his isolation from the world.

<p>My favourite movie from my childhood, it continues the adventures of Andy's toys and introduces new characters to join them. Despite being
considered the weakest entry in the Toy Story trilogy, this is my favourite one in the series. In this movie, Woody has been taken away by a 
suspicious individual and Buzz with Rex, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky and Hamm went on a journey to rescue him. The dynamic of Woody and Buzz is the best part
of the film, seeing them become good friends and work together when they were just beating each other up in the last movie is very fun and amazing
to watch as a kid. It made me realize that someone who is your enemy today, may become your friend later. The addition of Jessie, Bullseye and the
three little alien toys, made me giddy with excitement as a kid, because I knew that in the next movie I will see them again and they will 
definitely make the next one interesting. This movie surprisingly handles the themes of abandonement well for a cartoon made for children, 
it was very sincere and heartfelt instead being angsty and whiny. The movie is a joy to watch from beginning to end, and its humor is funny enough
for adults to enjoy it too.
<br>
<br><br>
Although I am fond of this movie, nostalgia won't affect my rating of this film and I give it a decent score of <b>7.5/10</b>. The movie is fun and
a good watch when you're with your family. The hardwork Pixar studios put into the film makes sure that it holds up well even with new animated
movies with better animation has come out.

<p style="font-size:120%; color:Maroon;">Lars and the Real Girl</p> 
<div style="font-size:80%; color:black; position:relative; margin-left:205px; bottom:35px">(2007)</div>

<p>Lars and the Real Girl is a comedy drama about a man who has trouble connecting with other people because of his childhood, and the lengths the people 
in his community would go for him. Lars the titular protagnist, is known as a shy but sweet guy in the small town he lives in.
One day, he bought a plastic doll made for adults and claim that she (the doll) is his online girlfriend from overseas who came to visit. 
The town doctor saw this as a chance to help Lars get over his antisocial behaviour and asks the whole town to go along with him.
The doctor asked everyone in their town to interact with Lars and his "girlfriend" to make him feel 
accepted and develop his social skills by building his relationship with other people. Ryan Gosling acts a very convincing socially 
awkward guy, that you wouldn't believe that the roles he usually plays are handsome leading men. Although the movie is a hard
watch from all the secondhand embarrassment you will feel, the movie is very deep and meaningful as it takes a dive at Lars' psyche and why he acts
the way he do.
<br>
<br><br>
Watching this movies has given me realisations about my life I am determined to change, like Lars I am also shy, though not on the same level as he is. 
But while I was watching the movie I realized that I am one bad day away from being him and this gave me determination to break out of my shell,
little by little. I really like movies that makes me think and because of that I give this movie a score of <b>8/10</b>.
